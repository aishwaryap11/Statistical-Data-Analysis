As convenient as it would be, education is not a one-size-fits-all system. Students are unique individuals
who come from different backgrounds that may affect the way they learn and how successful they are
with traditional schooling. Many factors could affect student performance outcomes and it is important
to review each domain of a studentâ€™s personal life to understand successful and challenging patterns for
students. Knowing factors that are linked with greater or lower success in academics allows educators to
identify better approaches to support students who may be struggling. The more mindful that we can
be about our approaches to academic intervention, the more effective these support methods may be.
This project focuses on the impacts of family dynamics on student success in their Mathematics class. 
Family dynamics will encapsulate the factors such as parent cohabitation status, parent
work status, family support and quality of family relationships. Most students in secondary school will
still live with their parents and thus these family factors have the potential to have a large impact on
academic success. This will be explored throughout the following work.
